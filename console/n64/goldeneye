GoldenEye 007 introduced stealth elements not seen in previous first-person shooter games.[7]

GoldenEye 007 was released on 25 August 1997, nearly two years after the film. The game's cartridge size was 96 Mb (12 MB).[27] 

Additionally, every cartridge of the game contains a fully functional ZX Spectrum emulator with ten Rare developed games. This function was originally made as an experimental side project by Rare staff and was deactivated in the final build of the game, but has since been unlocked through fan-developed patches.[28]

when the game was released, the first-person shooter was primarily a genre for PC gamers. Journalists noted that the game "opened the genre to a completely new market" and that it was "the first big console [first-person shooter] that truly got it right."[40]
